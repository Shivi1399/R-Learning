## INTRODUCTION 
Chris Harris was facing a crisis. Word had just been passed down from senior management that unless the London Jets hockey franchise could significantly increase revenues within the next season, the franchise would be sold, meaning that the city of 330,000 people would lose their major sports franchise. As the marketing manager of single-ticket sales (non-season tickets) for the team, Harris had been involved in a high-budget ad campaign that ran for most of the previous year. The results were mediocre at best. While the number of new customers and total sales had risen slightly, the increased revenues were largely offset by the costs of the ad campaign. 

Harris needed to determine quickly if there was a way to increase the return on his marketing investment. Harris wondered if he knew the Jetsâ€™ target market as well as he thought he did.

## CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
Harris decided that an RFM analysis should be followed by a segmentation analysis to determine which kinds of customers were most valuable to the Jets. He scrolled through the customer list for a few minutes trying to decide how he should segment the customers.

## THE CHALLENGE
Harris felt he now knew what had to be done to develop an individualized marketing strategy for single- ticket customers and he has called you in, as his assistant, to do the actual work. He has also provided you with the Excel spreadsheets.
