[storms.r](./src/storms.r) contains answers to the below assignment questions. 
## Assignment

Use `dplyr` libaray
1. Create a table (e.g. tibble/dataframe) storm_names_1980s containing the name and year of storms recorded during the 1980s (i.e. from 1980 to 1989).

2. Create a table (e.g. tibble) storms_per_year containing the number of storms recorded in each year (i.e. counts or frequencies of storms in each year). This table should contain two columns: year values in the first column, and number of storms in the second column.

3. Create a table (e.g. tibble) storm_records_per_year containing three columns:    
    - name of storm, 
    - year of storm, and 
    - count for number of records (of the corresponding storm).

4. Display the different (unique) types of storm status.

5. Display the different types of storm categories.


6. Create a table (e.g. tibble) storms_categ5 containing the name and year of those storms of category 5.

7. Display a table showing the status, avg_pressure (average pressure), and avg_wind (average wind speed), for each type of storm category. This table should contain four columns: 
    - category, 
    - status, 
    - avg_pressure, and 
    - avg_wind.


8. Create a table (e.g. tibble) max_wind_per_storm containing three columns: 
    - year of storm, 
    - name of storm, and 
    - max_wind maximum wind speed record (for that storm).

9. Create a table (e.g. tibble) max_wind_per_year containing three columns: 
    - year of storm, 
    - name of storm, and 
    - wind maximum wind speed record (for that year). Arrange rows by wind speed in decreasing order.

10. What are the top 5 storm categories with the highest average wind speeds?

11. How many storms were recorded in each category for each year?

12. For each storm category, what is the average pressure and wind speed recorded?

13. Which storm category had the highest number of records in each year?
